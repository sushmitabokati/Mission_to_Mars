### Challenges:
One of the biggest challenge i faced during the process was to work arround with the mongo db and the flask. One of the challenges i faced was after installing the Mongodb I couldnot create /data/db folder. Even if i had created i was getting the permission issue. Below is the steps involved to fix it(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034955/read-only-file-system-when-attempting-mkdir-data-db-on-mac). 
	- sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db (Create the data/db folder).
	- sudo chown -Rid -un/System/Volumes/Data/data/db (Give permissions).
	- mongod --dbpath=/System/Volumes/Data/data/db (Change dbpath of mongodb).
